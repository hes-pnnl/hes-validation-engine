hescore_json_schema
===================
The _base.schema.js file is maintained by NREL: 
https://github.com/NREL/hescore-hpxml/blob/master/hescorehpxml/schemas/hescore_json.schema.json

To get our schema, import hescore_json.schema.js. We enrich the base schema with
additional rules that aren't provided by NREL, either because they just haven't
incorporated them into the schema yet, or because they are related to areas that
PNNL is responsible for, and we want to maintain control over them.
